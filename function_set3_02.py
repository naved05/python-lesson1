"""Ask the user to enter a number.
            - If the number is a single digit number,
                 add 7 to it, and print the number in its unitâ€™s place
            - If the number is a two digit number,
                raise the number to the power of 5, 
                and print the number in its unitâ€™s place
            - If the number is a three digit number, 
                ask the user to enter another number. 
                Add the 2 numbers and print the number in its unitâ€™s place
            Use the solution provided in S03Q01 as the template for this exercises.
            - Instead of doing a print to print the final result in "perform_check" function 
            call separate functions : 
               do_1digit_oper() and
               do_2digit_oper() and
               do_3digit_oper()
            that will perform the required operations based on the number of digits
